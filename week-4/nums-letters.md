##What does puts do?

Puts executes what is sent to it, prints the result, and returns nil to whatever called it.

##What is an integer? What is a float?

Integers are whole numbers and integer operations only return whole numbers. Floats are numbers with decimal points, and operations will return floats.

##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division doesn't include the remainder, and can only be done with whole numbers. Float
division includes remainders in the result.

For someone who doesn't know, I would tell them that integer division is like the division that they were taught before they learned about decimals.
