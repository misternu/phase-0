##What does puts do?

Puts executes what is sent to it, prints the result, and returns nil to whatever called it.

##What is an integer? What is a float?

Integers are whole numbers and integer operations only return whole numbers. Floats are numbers with decimal points, and operations will return floats.

##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division doesn't include the remainder, and can only be done with whole numbers. Float
division includes remainders in the result.

For someone who doesn't know, I would tell them that integer division is like the division that they were taught before they learned about decimals.

##Mini Challenges

```
def hoursInYear()
  puts 365*24
end

def minutesInDecade()
  puts 10*365*24*60
end
```

##How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

The operators + - * / are placed between two numbers, and the output can depend on the variable type of the numbers.

##What is the difference between integers and floats?

Integers are whole numbers, and floats are numbers with decimals.

##What is the difference between integer and float division?

Integer division doesn't keep the remainder. Float division keeps the remainder

##What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

A string is a series of characters, you would use them for displaying output or storing and analyzing words or other user input.

##What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are for temporarily storing information that the program needs.

##How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

It was a good review, but this was more than covered by what I had to study before the interview
