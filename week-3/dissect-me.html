  <h5>GitHub</h5>
  <p>
    So you're learning to code. One day, when writing something, you decide to do an expirament. "Oh no," you think, "what if I'm wrong? Better save a backup copy," so you make a duplicate of the file and get on with your business. This keeps happening. Before you know it you have a pile of extra files, some with dates and some without, that you have to manually sort through to find revisions. More and more cruft, no matter how naturally organized you are.

##What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

P tags seem to be the most used, we used sections twice this time because it made sense for the content. Lots of things with written content are going to have sections and paragraphs.

##How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The elements get displayed top to bottom in the order they were in the file, as long as there is no formatting.

##What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

This was the first time I had made a new snippet, I will do it more often. I have been trying to learn at least one new sublime text shortcut a day, there are enough out there to keep me busy.
