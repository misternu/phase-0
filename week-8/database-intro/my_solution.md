##What are databases for?
Storing large amounts of organized and related information.

##What is a one-to-many relationship?
When each item from one set is related to many from the other, but from the other set each is only related to one.

##What is a primary key? What is a foreign key? How can you determine which is which?
A primary key only isn't related to another set, where a foreign key is linked to another set. I don't yet know how to tell when there is a link, other than from naming conventions.

##How can you select information out of a SQL database? What are some general guidelines for that?
We use the SELECT foo FROM bar command, and follow it up with various options. As general guidelines, I would say to separate the logic of the command into multiple lines to keep track of what you are doing, and to place limits on your output so that it isn't overwhelming.
