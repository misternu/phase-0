Bash is both a unix shell and shell scripting language. The most challenging part was trying to follow along in the terminal during the introduction video, shouldn't have tried that.The only command that I couldn't get to work properly was the 'apropos' command, other Mac users reported similar issues. I think the two most important commands are cd and ls, getting around and seeing what's there. I can remember the listed commands:

-pwd Prints the working directory

-ls Lists the files in the working directory

-mv Moves or renames files

-cd Changes the current directory

-../ The parent directory

-touch Make an empty file

-mkdir Make a directory

-less Scrollable read only text viewer

-rmdir Remove a directory

-rm Remove a file or directory

-help Lists bash commands
