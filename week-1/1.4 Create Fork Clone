To create a new repository, click the 'new repository' button on github. Name the repository, choose a license, and click create. You will also want to clone a local copy, a clone URL is on the right hand side of the page. In terminal type "git clone [that URL]".

To fork a repository, click the fork button in the top right corner of the repos main page, and select your user account. This will make a copy of the current state of that repo in your repos.

This is useful so that you can make your own changes without messing up the original repository. In this case we are using it so that we can get copies of class materials to work on later.

I have lightly used git before, the main struggle that I had was getting it to remember my username and password for me. I ended up googling it.
