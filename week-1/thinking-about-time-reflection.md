In this challenge I reviewed the idea of pomodoros, where one sets a timer for 25 minutes to complete a task, and then takes at least a 5 minute break. I watched and read information from Charles Duhigg about how habits are formed by behaviors, not mindsets (you hear this one paraphrased from Aristotle a lot).

Time boxing is when you set a small amount of time to complete a task. When you reach the end of the time, you must stop to reflect on what has been accomplished.

I currently use a system called "Getting Things Done" (GTD) that is too complex to summarize here. I meditate almost daily, but not on a routine. My time management is not working. The main reason is that I don't have work or another structure to build around.

During phase zero I will be testing out the time blocking method, putting my meditation on a schedule, and taking better care of my body.
