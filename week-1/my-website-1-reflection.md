- Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

  <http://misternu.github.io>

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

  On the main GitHub page, click '+ new repository'. Give the repositor a name, and click 'create repository'. On the right hand side of the page, copy the text under 'https clone URL'. Open the terminal on your computer and type 'git clone' followed by a space. Paste the URL that you copied from GitHub, and press enter. A copy of the repository is now on your computer.

- Describe what open source means.

  Open source means that anyone can read your code. There are legal restrictions on what they then do with your code, depending on what license you include with it. Sometimes, even when you can read the code, software isn't open source because of the particular license.

- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

  Two thumbs up. I don't feel nervous about it at all, as long as you think first before choosing to make something open source or closed source. As for whether open source is utopian, would you rather live in a world where Perl is locked down like Java? (google "Oracle sues Google")

- Assess the importance of using licenses.

  Licenses are important for specifying and controlling the legal repercussions of letting everyone read your code, without having to approve uses of your copyrighted material on a case by case basis.

- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

  We reviewed the procedures of creating a repository and making a change through a pull request. We reviewed what 'open source' means and learned what licensing is for.

- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
