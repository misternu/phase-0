Git is software that keeps a history of the changes that you make to code. The changes that you make are chunked into commits, which are collections of file manipulations that can be undone at a later time. The history is also split into branches, each of which contains a different (but overlapping) set of commits. All of the branches are stored in the repository on your computer. This is the main task of version control, a stored history of all changes made to a project, that you can revert to any part of at any time. You can push and pull changes from your repository to other people's copy of the repository, for teamwork.

GitHub is a social code hosting service that stores repositories where multiple people can access them. When your work is complete locally, you can push it to githubs copy of the repository. Now, when other people want to work on the code, they can pull down the changes (commits) that you made, and their working environment will contain your new code. This is useful, since having a central repository to push/pull from is less complicated than going to each person's repository.

The important difference to remember is that Git is the version control system, and GitHub is a service that hosts an online copy of Git repositories.
