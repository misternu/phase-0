#What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

Information gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Delivery, Maintenance

#What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The goal of the site is to demonstrate competencies and give links to information. There may be screenshots of portfolio sites along with the links to them. A picture of myself, a self description, links to various media.

#What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

The target audience is not interested in getting bogged down in too many details. They want to get in, get information, and get out. I think I should focus less on a life story and laundry list of skills, more on general feel and general competence.

#What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I want people who already have my contact information to be impressed by me, and I want people who are impressed by me to seek my contact information.

#What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Design shouldn't be about how things look so much as it is about problem solving. When creating a user experience, we should remember that it is impossible to create the same experience for everyone.

#What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User experience design is about paying attention to how the design of a site makes people feel when they are using it. This is done either through psychological prediction or experimental data collection.

#Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I tried to use omnigraffle, which turned out to be a very counterintuitive drawing tool. In the future I will be sticking either to GIMP or using simplified tools like writemaps
