<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	Pretty easy, mostly because everything is still only semantic.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	My pair already knew a lot, and was able to teach me new things.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	We added an alignment attribute to the logo and advertisement, I didn't realize till later to take this out.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
	What is good is that it is backwards compatible with any existing internet connected computer. What is bad is that everything built on top of it is getting increasingly complex.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	My mneumonics are kind of strange. For instance, when I want to remember that the tag for links is an "a" for anchor, I remember the old netscape logo (which doesn't have an A in it, so why does that work?).
